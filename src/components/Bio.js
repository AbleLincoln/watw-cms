          Wyman &amp; The Wolves roll in like a storm with a sound and energy
          that is truly their own. The member’s collective influences vary
          across a broad spectrum, yet converge and unite into what the band
          describes as <Bold>Cosmic Country Soul</Bold>. Whether a dark
          gypsy-esque rambling country tune, an emotional groove laden number,
          or an all out rocker, these dudes make it pure and play with a fiery
          intensity!

          only took a few short moments in a cozy rehearsal space in Burbank, CA
          to know something magical was on the bound.

          Latitudes Studio with Eric Corne behind the boards. Tracked live, the
          recordings capture the raw essence of a group finding their true flow
          and the spark that is sure to become a{' '}
